2. **Include**: 
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

- **Resolution**: Timeline for fix deployment
- **Credit**: Public acknowledgment (if desired)

## Security Considerations for The Collective

### Architecture Security

- **Redis Security**: Secure Redis configuration with authentication
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in backpressure management to prevent abuse
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are sanitized
- **Connection Limits**: Configurable limits to prevent resource exhaustion

### Production Deployment

- **Environment Variables**: Never commit secrets to version control
- **TLS/SSL**: Always use HTTPS in production
- **Firewall**: Restrict Redis access to application servers only
- **Monitoring**: Enable comprehensive logging and monitoring

### Known Security Features

1. **Backpressure Management**: Prevents DDoS and connection flooding
2. **Rate Limiting**: Per-IP and global connection limits
3. **Graceful Shutdown**: Prevents data corruption during deployments
4. **Anonymous Users**: No personal data collection or storage
5. **Minimal Attack Surface**: Stateless architecture with Redis-only persistence

### Security Best Practices

When deploying The Collective:

1. **Use strong Redis passwords**
2. **Enable Redis AUTH and TLS**
3. **Configure appropriate rate limits**
4. **Monitor connection patterns**
5. **Keep dependencies updated**
6. **Use container security scanning**
7. **Implement proper network segmentation**

### Dependencies

We regularly scan dependencies for vulnerabilities and maintain updates for security patches.
